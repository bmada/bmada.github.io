## Definition
A **manifold** $$ M $$ is a topological space $$ (M, \mathcal{T}) $$ such that for all $$ x \in M $$, there is some neighbourhood of $$ U $$ of $$ x $$ and some integer $$ n $$ such that $$ U $$ is [homeomorphic][homeomorphism] to $$ \mathbb{R}^n $$. That is, there exists a continuous function

$$ \varphi \colon U \longrightarrow \mathbb{R}^n $$

## Definition
A **manifold-with-boundary** is a topological space $$ Y $$, such that for all $$ y \in Y $$, there is some neighbourhood of $$ U $$ of $$ y $$ and some integer $$ n $$ such that $$ U $$ is [homeomorphic]({{ site.url }}/glossary/homeomorphism/) to either $$ \mathbb{R}^n $$ or $$ \mathbb{H}^n $$, where

$$ \mathbb{H}^n = \{ (x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n) \in \mathbf{R}^n : x_n > 0 \}. $$

{::comment}
$$ \partial M $$

## Examples

- $$ \mathbf{R}^n $$ is the most basic example

- An open ball

## Properties

- An open subset of a manifold is also a manifold.
