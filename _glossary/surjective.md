## Definition
A function $$ f \colon X \to Y $$ is **surjective** if every element in codomain $$ Y $$ is mapped to by an element in the domain $$ X $$. That is, for all $$ y \in Y $$, there exists $$ x \in X $$ such that $$ f(x) = y $$.

## Examples

- Let $$ X $$ be any set. Then the identity map $$ f \colon X \to X $$ defined by $$ f(x) = x $$ for all $$ x $$ is surjective since given any $$ y \in X $$, we have $$ f(y) = y $$.

- The polynomial $$ p(x) = x^3 - x $$ is surjective since $$ p \to \pm\infty $$ as $$ x \to \pm\infty $$. The intermediate value theorem guarantees for any $$ y \in \mathbf{R} $$, the existence of $$ x \in \mathbf{R} $$ such that $$ p(x) = y $$.

## Properties

- The composition $$ g \circ f \colon X \to Z $$ of surjective functions $$ f \colon X \to Y $$ and $$ g \colon Y \to Z $$ is surjective.
