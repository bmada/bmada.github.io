_The Grid_ explores the history of the U.S. electrical grid in an entertaining and engaging way, but leaves the reader wanting more in the other parts of the book. 

The origin and history of the modern day electrical grid is fascinating, and Bakke does an excellent job thoughly recounting this well researched tail. Beginning with electrical lighting in the late 1800s, we are taken through the war of currents and brought right up to the near present in a compelling and amusing journey. However, once this history is completed, the book becomes much less interesting. These later chapters unfortunately at times seem irrelevant and excessive, often filled with anecdotes that last for pages. Nonetheless, Bakke manages to convey the enormous complexity of the grid and the future challenges that await us in a readable and compelling way.

_The Grid_ is focussed almost exclusively on the U.S. grid: yes, this is made clear from the beginning with the subtitle, but the book feels incomplete without some treatment of experiences around the world, espcially in the later sections. Diagrams graphs and pictures are severly lacking, and this topic is certainly one that exemplifies the 1000 word worth of an image.

Bakke's background in anthropology gives an interesting perspective, one that is very different to, say, an electrical engineer. This adds something to the book and widens the audience enormously: if this were written by an engineer, it would be about 20 times the length and 30 times more dense. Technically, it is quite sound, though there are some minor mistakes. But the book is not at all intended to be a reference textbook, its appeal is the entertaining history that educates the reader about the not-often-thought-about complexities that exist in electricity grids. In that sense, it is a complete success.
